## Key commands

```bash
# Onboarding (first clone; also available as `just init`)
just setup                      # git hooks + cargo check + bun install + setup-wasm
just setup-wasm                 # wasm toolchain alone (wasm32 + wasm-bindgen-cli + wasm-opt)

# Native (Rust)
cargo test --workspace          # ~98 tests across spackle / cli / spackle-wasm

# Build (all / per-component)
just build                      # CLI binary + wasm + TS dist
just build-cli                  # target/release/spackle
just build-wasm                 # scripts/build-wasm.sh → ts/pkg/ (web target, flat)
just build-ts                   # wasm + tsc emit to ts/dist/ (npm package)

# TS package (@a2-ai/spackle) — test / demo
just test-ts                    # builds wasm, then bun test in ts/
just demo-ts                    # runs ts/scripts/demo.ts
```

CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs cargo tests + bun tests. `.github/workflows/build.yaml` is the release pipeline (goreleaser CLI binaries + wasm tarball).

## Architecture in one paragraph

`spackle` (core) is generic over a `FileSystem` trait (`src/fs.rs`) — every fs-touching function takes `&impl FileSystem`. Native callers pass `StdFs`. The wasm path lives in `crates/spackle-wasm/`, which depends on `spackle` and implements its own `MemoryFs`. Rust never crosses the wasm boundary for I/O — it's a **bundle-in / bundle-out pure function**: TS host hands in `Array<{path, bytes: Uint8Array}>`, Rust generates entirely in-memory, returns `{ files, dirs }`. The TS package (`ts/`) writes the output bundle to disk (or wherever) on its side.

## Naming conventions (settled after course corrections — don't re-flip)

- **TS package dir is `ts/`**, not `wasm/`. It's a TypeScript package, not the wasm binary.
- **Consumer docs live at `docs/ts/`**, not `docs/wasm/`.
- **npm-style package name is `@a2-ai/spackle`**, no `-wasm` suffix. Not published to the npm registry.
- **Rust crate is `spackle-wasm`** — that name IS accurate (the wasm-bindgen surface crate).
- **Internal subdir `ts/src/wasm/`** stays named `wasm/` — it's the wasm-bindgen wrapper subsystem inside the TS package.

## Distribution

**Not published to npm.** The wasm TS package ships as a tarball attached to each GitHub release (`a2-ai-spackle-<version>.tgz`, from `bun pm pack` in the release workflow). `bun add git+ssh:...` does **not** work because `package.json` is at `ts/`, not the repo root, and no JS package manager supports subpath specifiers on git URLs. For dev iteration use `bun link` or a local tarball; for shared pre-releases use the GitHub release asset URL. See `ts/README.md` for the full install menu.

## Non-obvious invariants (don't accidentally break)

- **No `std::fs` in the wasm binary.** `StdFs` is `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`. `spackle-wasm` uses `MemoryFs` only.
- **`canonicalize()` removed from core.** `Project::get_name` / `get_output_name` use `file_stem()` / `file_name()` directly. Canonicalization happens host-side (`DiskFs` does it for containment).
- **Bundle output paths are relative to `outDir`.** Host prepends its real disk root. Simplifies the contract; don't change back to absolute.
- **Output bundle carries `files` AND `dirs`.** Empty dirs must survive the round-trip to match native `copy::copy`'s `create_dir_all` behavior. Dropping `dirs` silently regresses parity.
- **`DiskFs.writeOutput` refuses a pre-existing `outDir`.** Matches native `GenerateError::AlreadyExists`. Don't weaken this without matching native too.
- **Path containment uses `path.resolve` + prefix check, not `split("/")` blocklists.** Handles platform-specific separators transparently.
- **`slugify` appears in `pkg/spackle_wasm.d.ts`.** Incidental tera export. Ignore.
- **Web target requires `await init()` before exports work.** `ts/src/wasm/index.ts` calls it lazily inside `loadSpackleWasm()` and caches the promise; consumers of the TS wrapper see an async API and never touch init themselves.
- **`wasm-bindgen-cli` version must match the `wasm-bindgen` crate version exactly.** `scripts/build-wasm.sh` reads it from `Cargo.lock` and refuses to run on mismatch; `just setup-wasm` installs the right one.

## Hooks

**Planned in wasm, executed host-side.** `plan_hooks` in `crates/spackle-wasm/src/lib.rs` delegates to a local `plan_hooks_native_parity` function — a reimplementation of `hook::evaluate_hook_plan`'s inner loop that reorders the checks to match `run_hooks_stream` semantics exactly: is_enabled → is_satisfied → **template before conditional** (so broken templates in hooks with false `if`s still hard-abort, matching native `Error::ErrorRenderingTemplate`), and returns `Failed` for conditional-eval errors instead of `Skipped`. It also injects `_project_name` + `_output_name` and honors caller-supplied `hook_ran` overrides (executed hooks skipped from iteration but kept in the `items` set for needs resolution). The TS package ships `NodeHooks` (child_process) and `BunHooks` (Bun.spawn); `defaultHooks()` auto-selects per runtime. Top-level `runHooksStream(projectDir, outDir, data, fs)` is an async generator that iterates the plan, yielding `HookEvent`s (`run_start` → per-hook `hook_start` / `hook_end` with timing → optional `replan` → terminal `template_errors` / `plan_error`), and re-plans internally after any non-zero exit so chained conditionals see actual state. Mirrors native `run_hooks_stream` failure semantics (continue on non-zero exit; template errors are a hard abort before any execution). Consumers driving an SSE bridge `for await` the generator and relay each event. See `ts/src/host/hooks.ts` and `docs/ts/hooks.md`.

**Session API deferred.** Each `runHooksStream()` iteration re-parses the bundle — sub-millisecond, dwarfed by subprocess time. A stateful `open_session(bundle, project_dir)` + `plan_hooks_session(...)` API would amortize parse across the plan-execute loop; not warranted until profiles show per-call parse dominating.

**Not exposed in the wasm path:** `run_as_user` / polyjuice (hosts can wrap in their `SpackleHooks.execute` if needed); hooks in `generateBundle` (bundle-only mode has no real cwd).

## Development practices

### Rust

- **Table-driven tests where appropriate.** When a function has multiple input/output cases that share shape, collect them into a single `Vec<(input, expected)>` (or struct-per-case) and assert in a loop. Keeps related cases visible together and keeps failure messages identifying the case. One-off edge cases stay as individual `#[test]` fns — don't force everything into tables.
- **`cargo fmt` before committing.** The workspace uses default rustfmt config.

### TypeScript (`ts/`)

- **Lint with `oxlint`**: `bun run lint` (check), `bun run lint:fix` (apply).
- **Format with `oxfmt`**: `bun run fmt` (apply), `bun run fmt:check` (verify).
- Config lives at `ts/.oxlintrc.json` and `ts/.oxfmtrc.json`. Run from inside `ts/`.
- Both should pass before pushing. CI runs `bunx tsc --noEmit` separately for type-checking.

### Don't adopt external crates for core abstractions casually

The `FileSystem` trait is hand-rolled, not borrowed from `vfs` or similar. Adopting a widely-used abstraction is defensible — but only when it fits the usage pattern better than what we have. For whole-file reads/writes we prefer byte-buffer shapes (`read_file → Vec<u8>`) over stream shapes (`Box<dyn SeekAndRead>`).

## Before editing

- If you're touching the wasm path, skim `docs/design/wasm.md` for the architecture + invariants.
- If you're touching tests or fixtures, see `tests/fixtures/` (basic_project, bad_template, typed_slots) — the bun tests consume the same fixtures.
